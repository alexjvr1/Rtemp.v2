#Population genomic evidence for temperature adaptation in the European common frog, Rana temporaria, across a latitudinal gradient in Scandinavia. 


Motivation 

There is plenty of ecological and quantitative genetic evidence of adaptation to environment across the latitudinal gradient in Scandinavia

However, little is known about the genomic signature of adaptation. 

In addition, demographic history is also unclear, as mitochondrial-based phylogeography shows very little diversity (i.e. evidence of rapid colonisation). 

So the aim of this paper is two-fold

1. Describe the colonisation and demographic history of Rana temporaria across Scandinavia. And describe the current population structure. 
2. Look for genomic signals of selection across the environmental gradient. 



#Part 1:

1. What is the colonisation history? 

  - H1: contact zone in the middle of Scandinavia. 
  - H0: colonisation from the N or the S throughout. 
  
Method: Find populations with increased nucleotide diversity - i.e. look for signals similar to hybrid zones. (detection of contact zone).
